# Introduction
Machine Learning come across many different terms such as `artificial intelligence`, `machine learning`, `neural network`, and `deep learning`. But what do these terms actually mean and how do they relate to each other?

Below given a brief description of these terms:

**Artificial Intelligence:** A field of computer science that aims to make computers achieve human-style intelligence. There are many approaches to reaching this goal, including `machine learning` and `deep learning`.

**Machine Learning:** A set of related techniques in which computers are trained to perform a particular task rather than by explicitly programming them.

**Neural Network:** A construct in `Machine Learning` inspired by the network of neurons (nerve cells) in the biological brain. `Neural networks` are a fundamental part of `deep learning`.

**Deep Learning:** A subfield of `machine learning` that uses multi-layered neural networks. Often, “machine learning” and “deep learning” are used interchangeably.

**Machine learning** and **deep learning** also have many subfields, branches, and special techniques. A notable example of this diversity is the separation of **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Learning**.

To over simplify — in supervised learning you know what you want to teach the computer, while unsupervised learning is about letting the computer figure out what can be learned. Supervised learning is the most common type of machine learning.

There are many types of neural network architectures. However, no matter what architecture you choose, the math it contains (what calculations are being performed, and in what order) is not modified during training. Instead, it is the internal variables (“weights” and “biases”) which are updated during training.

For example, in the Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion problem, the model starts by multiplying the input by some number (the weight) and adding another number (the bias). Training the model involves finding the right values for these variables, not changing from multiplication and addition to some other operation.
